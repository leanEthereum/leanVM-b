# Runtime-sized HeapBuf: the cell count is carried *in the exponent* — the
# buffer holds k cells where the size value is g^k. So a size derived from a
# runtime g-power is plain field arithmetic. Here a hinted count m = g^2 gives
# a buffer of m·m = g^4 = 4 cells; the four cells are filled from a witness
# stream and XOR-summed (`+` is XOR): 1^2^4^8 = 15. Published: (15, GEN ** 3).
# public_input: 15, GEN ** 3
# witness m: GEN ** 2
# witness vals: 1, 2, 4, 8
