# `match_range(log(x), range(a, b), lambda i: …, …)` — a match with generated
# arms: arm j is the lambda body with i replaced by the integer literal j, and
# every arm writes its results into the same fresh cells (write-once: exactly
# one arm executes), bound to the assignment targets. Ranges are contiguous
# from 0. With x = GEN ** 3: shift(3) = 3·g = 6, and the second pair's
# two(3) = (3, 3·g) = (3, 6), so a + b = 3 + 6 = 5 (`+` is XOR).
# public_input: 6, 5
