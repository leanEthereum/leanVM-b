# Pins the scoping semantics: bindings (and compile-time index constants)
# made inside a branch are local to it, and the lazily-cached range-check
# constant cells revert at the join. The not-taken branch below materializes
# a bound-16 cell that must NOT leak to the check after the join — a leak
# would read an unwritten cell and fail witness generation loudly.
# Published: (9, 6).
# public_input: 9, 6
