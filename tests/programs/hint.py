# `hint_witness(dest, "name")` pops the next *entry* (a slice of values) of a
# named prover stream into a StackBuf or a StackBuf/HeapBuf slice — zero
# cycles, and completely unconstrained: every hinted value below is pinned
# down by the program itself (a range check, equality asserts, an XOR
# relation). The same symbol may be hinted many times: each `# witness` line
# is one entry, and the two pops of "r" consume its two entries in order.
# Published: (GEN ** 5, 6).
# public_input: GEN ** 5, 6
# witness r: GEN ** 5, 12
# witness r: 9
# witness h: 3, 5, 6
