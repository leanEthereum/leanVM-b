# A runtime mul_range stop bound: the loop walks ×GEN from the start element
# until it reaches a *runtime* g-power — here a hinted count, range-checked
# first (an unreachable bound would never terminate, so bounding the log is
# the program's duty). Repeated squaring: buf[g^k] holds g^{2^k}, so after
# n = 5 iterations buf[n] = g^32. The second loop's hinted bound equals its
# start: zero iterations, its impossible assert never runs.
# Published: (g^32, g^5).
# public_input: GEN ** 32, GEN ** 5
# witness n: GEN ** 5
# witness m: 1
