//! leanVM-b — arithmetization of a minimal binary-field zkVM (see `doc.tex` and
//! `misc/transition-to-64-bits.tex`).
//!
//! Every machine value is an element of `K = GF(2^64)`, and logical indices are
//! powers of a fixed generator `g`, so incrementing an index is a multiplication
//! by `g` — a free virtual operation needing no addition gadget. The witness is
//! `K`-valued and committed directly by a dense multilinear PCS (no
//! bit-decomposition); every challenge and transcript scalar lives in the
//! degree-2 tower `E = GF(2^128) = K[y]`, so all interactive error terms keep
//! their `c/2^128` form.
//!
//! - [`compiler`] — Python-like zkDSL front end: parse → lower to the ISA → [`cpu::Program`].
//! - [`field`] — `K`/`E` re-exports, the generator `g`, and g-power helpers.
//! - [`transcript`] — Fiat–Shamir transcript (observe-and-fold in one op).
//! - [`multilinear`] — eq polynomial, folding, MLE and Lagrange evaluation (mixed `K`×`E`).
//! - [`pcs`] — `K`-committed witness, `E`-opened, via flock's Ligerito-K (§3).
//! - [`witness`] — `K`-valued columns stacked into one committed witness.
//! - [`gkr`] — the grand product via GKR (§4.3), balancing the bus.
//! - [`leaf`] — the shared bus: grand-product balance, decomposed to per-column claims (§4.2–§4.4, §5).
//! - [`constraints`] — the per-table degree-2 field zerocheck (§4.1).
//! - [`tables`] — the six instruction tables (columns, flushes, constraints).
//! - [`cpu`] — whole-program assembly, control flow, and the prove/verify entry points.
//! - [`blake3_flock`] — the `BLAKE3` glue: flock's R1CS validity proof over the same commitment.
