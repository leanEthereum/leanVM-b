//! Recursive aggregation of XMSS and SPHINCS signatures: one bytecode
//! (`guests/aggregate.py`) for every node of an aggregation tree.
//!
//! A node verifies `n_raw_xmss` XMSS signatures, `n_raw_sphincs` SPHINCS
//! signatures and `n_children` sub-proofs **of this same bytecode**, and
//! publishes the sorted deduplicated union of their signer sets. The XMSS
//! signers are grouped by epoch, each group
//! carrying its own message. A SPHINCS
//! signer carries its own message, so that half of the statement is a list of
//! `(key, message)` pairs. Coverage is what carries the security claim: a write-once slot per
//! declared signer, written once by each raw signature and each child key, plus
//! a final count, so every declared signer is backed by a real signature or a
//! verified child.
//!
//! Those slots are one contiguous region per XMSS epoch group and one for
//! SPHINCS, so the one range check a write already needs also keeps a
//! signature off another group's declared keys, of either scheme: that is what
//! makes the published split mean which scheme verified which key against
//! which `(epoch, message)`, at every level of the tree. A child's groups need
//! not equal its parent's: a hinted map, checked by the guest, ties each
//! non-empty child group to a parent group with the same epoch and message,
//! so a parent's list is the union of what sits below it. An XMSS slot holds the
//! key's two cells and a SPHINCS slot four, its key and its message, so the
//! guest reads each SPHINCS signature's message out of the slot it verifies.
//!
//! The bytecode is compiled to a fixed point on its own size
//! ([`unified_guest`]): the recursion placeholders depend on the inner bytecode
//! size, and here the inner bytecode is this one. Its digest does not need a
//! fixed point, riding the statement instead of the code.
//!
//! Three fixed polynomials (the stacked bytecode and flock's `A0`/`B0`) are too
//! big to evaluate in-circuit, so each node exports one deferred claim on each
//! and batches its children's carried claims with the fresh ones its
//! verifications raise (`doc/leanvm/main.tex` §Deferred evaluation claims). Only
//! the root's are discharged natively, by [`AggregateSignature::verify`].
//!
//! `gen_verify` derives the guest's whole witness for a child from the real
//! `cpu::layout` of the inner program and the summary of a real `cpu::verify`
//! run, so there is no hand-mirrored copy of the protocol to drift.
