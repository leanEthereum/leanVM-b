//! Bump arena for transient proving buffers. Each thread owns a slab, and [`enter_phase`] resets all slabs. An [`ArenaVec`] allocated in a phase becomes invalid at the next phase; values that outlive a phase must use `Vec`.
//!
//! # Reuse within a phase
//!
//! A prover is a pipeline: a stage's output is allocated while its input is
//! still live and the input dies first, so lifetimes are not nested and popping
//! the cursor reclaims almost nothing. Blocks of at least [`REUSE_MIN`] go to a
//! per-thread free list on release; anything it cannot serve falls back to the
//! bump.
//!
//! `ZK_ALLOC_POISON=1` fills a released block, and fills what a phase used when
//! it ends. Between them they catch the two use-after-free shapes the arena
//! otherwise hides: a buffer read after being dropped, and one that outlives its
//! phase.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```no_run
//! zk_alloc::enable_arena(); // once, at startup
//! let _phase = zk_alloc::enter_phase(); // bind before the phase's buffers
//! let buf: zk_alloc::ArenaVec<u64> = zk_alloc::ArenaVec::with_capacity(1 << 20);
//! ```
