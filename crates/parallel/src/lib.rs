//! Fixed-size thread pool for flat data-parallel kernels: "split a range, run a
//! closure on each piece". No work stealing, no per-dispatch allocation.
//!
//! # Why not a work-stealing pool
//!
//! Every parallel site in the prover has the same shape — a known number of
//! independent items, each writing its own disjoint slice. That needs a counter,
//! not a deque per worker. Owning the runtime also buys two things a general pool
//! cannot give: pinned per-worker scratch (see [`map_reduce_with_state`]) and
//! control over which cores the workers run on.
//!
//! # Heterogeneous cores
//!
//! On Apple silicon the pool spans **both** clusters: performance workers at
//! `USER_INTERACTIVE` and efficiency workers at `UTILITY`, all draining one
//! shared claim counter. Guided self-scheduling is what makes that safe — a
//! worker takes `remaining / (2·workers)` items at a time, so a slow efficiency
//! core simply claims fewer batches, and at the join it holds at most one
//! outstanding item. A pool that instead handed each worker an equal band would
//! gate every barrier on the slowest core, which is why the efficiency cores used
//! to need a separate pool and a separate queue.
//!
//! # Protocol
//!
//! - `total() - 1` background workers (ids `1..total()`); the dispatcher is
//!   worker 0 and runs its share inline.
//! - Dispatch bumps a `generation` counter that idle workers spin on, parking
//!   after `SPIN_LIMIT` spins. Completion is a `working` countdown the
//!   dispatcher spins on. `parked` is SeqCst-ordered against `generation`, so on
//!   each dispatch one side sees the other and no wakeup is lost.
//! - **No nesting.** A dispatch from inside a task would deadlock on the dispatch
//!   lock, so an `IN_TASK` guard panics instead. Every kernel fans out over its
//!   outermost independent unit and is sequential below that, so a nested dispatch
//!   means a mistake, not a slow path.
//! - A task panic is caught on its worker and re-raised on the dispatcher once
//!   the dispatch quiesces; the pool stays usable.
//! - One dispatcher at a time, serialized by the `dispatch` mutex.
