//! flock: a batched R1CS proving system for hash circuits over GF(2), reduced
//! to evaluation claims on the committed packed witness.
//!
//! Protocol flow (all challenges from the shared [`fiat_shamir`] transcript):
//!   1. The caller commits the packed Boolean witness `q_flock` (inside the VM's
//!      one stacked [`pcs`] commitment).
//!   2. [`zerocheck`] reduces `a·b ⊕ c = 0` over the cube to evaluation claims
//!      on `(â, b̂, ĉ)`.
//!   3. [`lincheck`] reduces those to the `2^k_skip` bit-slice values of `z` at
//!      one point, against the per-block matrices.
//!   4. The PCS binds that family of slices ([`hash::SliceClaim`]) to the
//!      commitment.
//!
//! [`hash`] is the one circuit: the BLAKE2s compression as a per-block R1CS,
//! plus its witness generation and the leanVM-facing reduction entry points
//! (`Blake2sSetup::{prove_reduction, verify_reduction, …}`). Steps 2 to 4 above
//! are circuit-agnostic: they take the block shape as plain numbers and reach
//! the matrices only through [`lincheck::LincheckCircuit`], whose one live impl
//! walks the circuit rather than reading any matrix.
//!
//! BLAKE2s is a 32-bit ARX round whose XORs and rotations are free over GF(2),
//! so its only nonlinear constraints are the product bits of the modular ADDs.
//! The private `gf2` module owns that part: the wire word and the two adder
//! gadgets, forwards and transposed, kept separate because the fused
//! three-operand adder's bit boundaries are the subtlest thing here.
