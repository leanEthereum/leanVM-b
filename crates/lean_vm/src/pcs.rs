//! Witness commitment: an inner-product PCS committing over `K = F_{2^64}` and
//! opening over `E = F_{2^192}` (doc §sec:stacking, §annex:pcs), reusing flock's **WHIR**. An
//! opening proves `Σ_x q(x)·W(x) = C` against any verifier-evaluable `E`-valued
//! weight `W` (a point evaluation `q̂(r)` is `W = eq(r,·)`). A batch of claims
//! `q̂(point_j) = value_j` folds with random `γ`s into one weight and target,
//! opened in a single WHIR run: the verifier evaluates the weight itself,
//! so it never travels. flock's ring-switched `q_flock` claims join the same batch
//! ([`::pcs::stack_open`]).
//!
//! The stacked witness is `2^μ` words, but its tail past the placed columns is
//! zero, and the L0 interleaving makes that tail whole lanes: lane `l` is the
//! contiguous block `q[l·2^(μ-LOG_BATCH) ..)`, so only
//! [`crate::witness::StackShape::n_lanes`] of them are ever encoded, and the
//! opening's dense weight, its first `LOG_BATCH` rounds and the stack allocation
//! shrink with them. A leaf image is still `2^LOG_BATCH` words, the absent lanes
//! contributing the zeros their codeword would have been, but they LEAD the image:
//! their whole 64-byte blocks are one chaining value every leaf shares, so the
//! committer hashes them once rather than once per leaf, and only the image's tail
//! rides the proof. Both sides derive the lane count from the announced layout.
//!
//! Security: the K configs use rate-1/2 Johnson list decoding with OOD binding
//! and 128-bit round-by-round soundness ([`::pcs::whir::SECURITY_BITS`]).
//! L0's opening claim supplies its binding evaluation; each deeper commitment
//! takes one explicit OOD sample. The base-field
//! commitment only shrinks the level-0 symbols to 8 bytes; every random
//! ingredient is sampled from `E` with the same error terms as before.
