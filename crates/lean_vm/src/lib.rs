//! leanVM-b — arithmetization of a minimal zkVM (see `misc/doc.tex`).
//!
//! Machine words are `c0 + c1*y + c2*y² ∈ E = K[y]/(y³ + y + 1)`.
//! Addresses, pc/fp, read counters, and logical indices live in
//! `K = GF(2^64)`; indices are powers of a fixed generator `g`, so incrementing
//! one is a multiplication by `g`, a free virtual operation. Every physical
//! witness column is K-valued (an E-valued word is three K-lane columns) and is
//! committed directly by a dense multilinear PCS. Challenges and transcript
//! scalars live in `E = GF(2^192)`, leaving ample margin for 128-bit soundness.
//!
//! - [`transcript`] — the shared Fiat–Shamir transcript (re-exported from `fiat_shamir`).
//! - [`pcs`] — `K`-committed witness, `E`-opened, via the stacked Ligerito (§3).
//! - [`witness`] — `K`-valued columns stacked into one committed witness.
//! - [`gkr`] — the grand product via GKR (§4.3), balancing the bus.
//! - [`leaf`] — the shared bus: grand-product balance, decomposed to per-column claims (§4.2–§4.4, §5).
//! - [`constraints`] — one back-loaded batched zerocheck over all seven tables'
//!   degree-2 identities plus their three bus forms (§4.1).
//! - [`tables`] — the seven instruction tables (columns, flushes, constraints).
//! - [`cpu`] — whole-program assembly, control flow, and the prove/verify entry points.
//! - [`blake3_flock`] — the `BLAKE3` glue: flock's R1CS validity proof over the same commitment.
//! - [`vmhash`]: VM-native hashing (one-block compression and standard BLAKE3 slice hashing).
