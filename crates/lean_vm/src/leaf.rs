//! direction; the bus balances when pushed and pulled tuples form the same
//! multiset, proven by two GKR passes over the leaf vectors `γ − π_α(σ)`. Each pass
//! reduces to a leaf claim `Ṽ₀(ζ)`, decomposed into evaluation claims on the
//! committed columns. Tuple coordinates `σ_i` are `K`-valued (column entries,
//! g-powers, separators); the fingerprint challenges `α, γ` are `E`-valued, so a
