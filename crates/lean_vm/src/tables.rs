//! Per-instruction tables (`doc/leanvm/body/07-instruction-tables.tex`). Each opcode is one [`Table`] impl that declares,
//! in one place, its committed columns, how to fill them from the trace, its bus
//! interactions (flushes), the read-count columns that feed the count channel,
//! and its degree-2 constraint. Column indices here are *local* (`0..n_committed_columns`);
//! `cpu`'s schema offsets them to global witness columns.
//!
//! Columns are `K`-valued (`F64`). The pc/fp, operands, counts, opcodes and
//! separators are single `K`-columns; a **machine word** (memory value) is
//! 192-bit (`E = F192`), committed as THREE `K`-lane columns. Nothing a row
//! DERIVES is a column at all: an operand address `fp·o`, an `XOR`/`MUL` result,
//! the `DEREF` store, the `JUMP` successors are each written out as the degree-2
//! bus coordinate that carries them (§sec:m3), which leaves `JUMP`'s is-nonzero
//! indicator as the one identity any table still has. Every identity is `K`-valued,
//! so a relation on machine words is written out lane by lane; after the round a
//! table joins the batch its columns are `E`-valued, which is what
//! `eval_constraint` takes.

// ---- the identities ----------------------------------------------------------
//
// Each is written ONCE, generic over the column type: `F64` in the round a table
// joins the batch, `F192` afterwards (see [`ColVal`]). Products of two `K`
// columns stay 64-bit and an `η`-power multiplies through `mul_e`.
//
// EVERY identity is `K`-valued, like the columns it reads and like the bus
// coordinates (§sec:air). A relation between machine WORDS is therefore written out
// lane by lane, with the tower multiplication unrolled by hand ([`TOWER_LANES`]),
// rather than assembled into one `E` equation. A table's identity slice is then a
// mixed dot product against its `η`-range: in the round a table joins the batch (the
// batch's largest) that is one 64-bit product per identity plus three PMULL for its
// `η`-power, with ONE reduction for the whole slice ([`ColVal::dot`]). One `E`-valued
// identity would instead cost a full `E×E` product against its `η`-power, plus a
// reduction of its own, and the lanes it bundles are the same lane polynomials
// either way.

// ---- BLAKE2s ------------------------------------------------------------------

/// `BLAKE2s` (“BLAKE2s” in `doc/leanvm/body/07-instruction-tables.tex`): one standard compression. The four 128-bit message
/// chunks are addressed *independently* at `fp·o_i` (`o_i = g^{ins[i]}`), each a
/// single cell, with no forced contiguity between chunks, so a caller hashing e.g.
/// `(tweak, pp)` need not copy them into adjacent cells. The chaining value and the
/// 32-byte output each occupy two consecutive cells, based at `fp·o_cv` and
/// `fp·o_c`, so the row reads eight cells in all. No address is committed: each rides the bus as the product `fp·o_X`
/// (§sec:m3). The compression relating output words to input words carries no
/// table constraint either: it is proven by flock's R1CS validity via `q_flock`
/// (§blake2s_flock), which leaves this table with no identity of its own.
///
/// A 128-bit chunk is two flock 64-bit words (lo, hi lanes), so the sixteen
/// memory-borne flock words are sixteen value LANE columns over eight cells,
/// plus the metadata immediate's two lanes. They are listed in
/// `n_committed_columns` (they need a local index for the flushes and are filled
/// from the trace for the bus), but `cpu` treats them as VIRTUAL (not committed)
/// and routes their bus claims to `q_flock`, which already holds those words (see
/// [`BLAKE2S_VALUE_COLS`]).
