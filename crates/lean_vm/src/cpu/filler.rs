//! Filling every table to a power of two, so that no table has padding rows.
//!
//! A table is proven over a power-of-two number of rows, so a run whose counts are not
//! powers of two has to make up the difference, and it makes it up by executing more
//! instructions. The bytecode carries, per table and per size in [`SIZES`], a *block*:
//! that many dummy instructions of the table's opcode, then a `JUMP` back to the block's
//! own first instruction, in the same frame (`lean_compiler::filler`).
//!
//! So a block is a **cycle**, and no program code jumps into it. That is what makes this
//! work: the state channel's tuples are pushed and pulled around the cycle and cancel
//! among themselves, for any number of traversals, so the fill is a closed loop running
//! beside the program's chain rather than part of it (doc §Filling the tables). The
//! prover picks how many times each block is traversed, and nothing has to be counted,
//! tested, or entered.
//!
//! A traversal of the size-`s` block costs exactly `s + 1` rows: `s` of its own table and
//! one `JUMP`. Nothing else, and nothing on any other table. That is what makes the solve
//! here exact, with no calibrated cost model and no residual to correct, and it is why
//! one interpretation of the program suffices: the interpreter solves once the program
//! has halted, by which point its row counts are final.
//!
//! The sizes are powers of two so any fill is reachable exactly, while the bulk rides the
//! largest block at one `JUMP` per 128 rows. A table already sitting on a power of two is
//! never entered at all.
