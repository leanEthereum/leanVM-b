//! The few-time signature: a forest of `k-1` Merkle trees of `2^a` secret
//! leaves, one leaf opened per tree at an index the message digest picks
//! (FORS+C).
//!
//! Reuse leaks rather than breaks: after `r` signatures on one instance an
//! adversary holds `r` leaves per tree, and can sign a message only if it lands
//! on that instance, has last index zero, and has every other index on a leaf it
//! already holds.
