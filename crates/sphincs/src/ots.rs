//! The one-time signature: `v` hash chains of `2^w - 1` steps, and the
//! target-sum code that replaces the Winternitz checksum (WOTS+C).
//!
//! A codeword is `v` chunks summing to `T`. Two distinct words of equal sum
//! cannot be ordered componentwise, so revealing chain position `x_i` on every
//! chain gives a forger nothing: any other codeword needs a value above one of
//! the revealed ones. The price is that most messages do not encode into the
//! code at all, hence the counter the signer searches for and the signature
//! carries.
