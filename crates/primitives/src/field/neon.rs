//! Small AArch64 SIMD helpers shared by the NEON kernels.
//!
//! The ARMv8.2 SHA3 extension, present on every Apple M core and enabled by
//! the workspace's `-C target-cpu=native`, provides `EOR3`, a three-way XOR
//! in one instruction. The binary-field kernels are XOR-dominated, so folding
//! pairs of dependent `EOR`s into single `EOR3`s cuts both instruction count
//! and dependency-chain length in the hot loops. Builds without the extension
//! transparently keep the two-`EOR` form.
//!
//! (`sha3` is the name of the ARMv8.2 feature *block* that carries `EOR3`,
//! not a reference to the hash function. This crate hashes with BLAKE2s.)
