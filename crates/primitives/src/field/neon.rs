//! Small AArch64 SIMD helpers shared by every NEON kernel in the workspace.
//!
//! The ARMv8.2 SHA3 extension — present on every Apple M core and enabled by
//! the workspace's `-C target-cpu=native` — provides `EOR3`, a three-way XOR
//! in one instruction. The binary-field kernels are XOR-dominated (GHASH
//! reduction, table-gather accumulation, unreduced product folds), so folding
//! pairs of dependent `EOR`s into single `EOR3`s cuts both instruction count
//! and dependency-chain length in the hot loops. Builds without the extension
//! transparently keep the two-`EOR` form.
