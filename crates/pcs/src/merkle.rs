//! Binary Merkle tree with BLAKE2s, SIMD-batching independent hashes across
//! leaves and internal levels through the lane-transposed multi-input hasher in
//! [`primitives::blake2s`].
//!
//! The committer's half. What a proof actually carries (the digest encoding,
//! the leaf/node hashes, one phase's pruned octopus) lives in
//! [`fiat_shamir::merkle`], beside the transcript that transports it; this
//! module only builds the tree those phases are cut from.
//!
//! Layout for `num_leaves = 2^k` leaves:
//!   tree[0..num_leaves]                              = leaf hashes (level k)
//!   tree[num_leaves..3·num_leaves/2]                 = level k−1
//!   ...
//!   tree[2·num_leaves − 2..2·num_leaves − 1]         = root (level 0)
//!
//! Total nodes: `2·num_leaves − 1`. The flat layout keeps the tree contiguous
//! in memory for cheap Merkle-path extraction later.
//!
//! Hashing is standard BLAKE2s-256. Independent hashes of equal-length inputs
//! step their block counters in lockstep, so the batched hasher is
//! byte-identical to an independent [`hash_leaf`] per input; the leaf-size
//! dispatch below exists only to make the length a compile-time constant.
//! Leaves of other sizes use the scalar path. Internal 64-byte child pairs,
//! which are one compression each, always take the batched path.
