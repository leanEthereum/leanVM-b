# `if` / `elif` / `else` on field equality (`==` / `!=`): one XOR and one
# conditional JUMP. Bindings made inside a branch are branch-local; branches
# communicate through write-once memory — only one branch executes, so both
# may write the same cell. The loop body's `if` runs in a helper frame (its
# own fp cell). Published: (5, 13 + 17) = (5, 28) — `+` is XOR.
# public_input: 5, 28
