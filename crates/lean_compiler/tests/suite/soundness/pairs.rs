//! Layer 2: equivalence. Two spellings the language documents as interchangeable
//! must accept exactly the same trials.
//!
//! This is the layer that finds dropped constraints without anyone having to
//! guess where they went. A dropped store is invisible on its own: the program
//! still runs, and its one honest witness still passes. It becomes visible the
//! moment you have a second spelling of the same intent that *kept* the store,
//! because then one side rejects a witness the other accepts, and the more
//! permissive side is the buggy one.
//!
//! Every pair here is a promise `zkDSL.md` makes. When one fails, quote the
//! promise in the bug report; the `why` field is there to be quoted.
