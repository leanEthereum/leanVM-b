//! Fill blocks (`lean_compiler::filler`): extra real rows so a table's height needs no
//! padding.
//!
//! What has to hold, and is checked here end to end:
//!
//! - every table comes out an exact power of two, whatever the program's row mix, so
//!   nothing is ever padded;
//! - the fill costs exactly what the solver says, a traversal being its block's rows
//!   plus one jump and nothing else;
//! - the filled trace proves and verifies.
//!
//! The second is what lets the interpreter solve once the chain has halted, in one
//! interpretation of the program, so it is worth pinning rather than assuming.
