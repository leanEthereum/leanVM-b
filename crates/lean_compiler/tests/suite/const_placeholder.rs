//! Global constants and compile-time placeholders in the zkDSL.
//!
//! A top-level `NAME = <const-expr>` is a **global constant**: it is evaluated
//! to its field value and substituted (as one literal) everywhere its name
//! appears below: so a constant is usable in every position a literal is,
//! including `StackBuf`/`HeapBuf` sizes, `**` exponents, and `assert log _ < _`
//! bounds. A **placeholder** is any identifier text-replaced before parsing via
//! [`parse_with_replacements`]; the idiom is a placeholder feeding a constant
//! (`V = V_PLACEHOLDER` with `"V_PLACEHOLDER" ↦ "128"`), as in leanVM.
