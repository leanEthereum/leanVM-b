//! Range checks *in the exponent*: `assert log x < log GEN ** k` (or
//! `assert log x < k`) proves `log_g(x) < k`, i.e. `x ∈ {g^0, g^1, …, g^{k-1}}`,
//! in 3 cycles: `DEREF x` bounds `log(x)` by the memory size, a `MUL` into the
//! write-once constant cell `g^{k-1}` back-solves and binds the complement
//! `y = g^{k-1-log(x)}`, and `DEREF y` bounds the complement. leanVM's DEREF
//! range-check trick, transported to g-powers; the only nondeterminism is the
//! end-of-run resolution of the two touched cells.
