//! Fill blocks: extra rows so every table's height is a power of two.
//!
//! A table is proven over a power-of-two number of rows, so a table whose execution
//! needs fewer has to make up the difference. The alternative to this module is padding
//! rows, which are not real rows: they put default tuples on the bus that nothing
//! matches, so the verifier has to be told each table's real row count and divide those
//! tuples back out. That correction was the most delicate part of the bus argument, and
//! it existed only for the instruction tables; unread memory cells and unexecuted
//! program entries already need nothing, their seed and finalize tuples cancelling.
//!
//! So run the difference off instead. Every program carries, past `main`'s halt, one
//! block per table per size in `lean_vm::cpu::filler::SIZES`: that many dummy
//! instructions of the table's opcode, then a `JUMP` back to the block's own first
//! instruction. Each block is therefore a cycle, and no program code enters one: on the
//! bus its state tuples cancel against each other rather than against the program's
//! chain, so it can be traversed any number of times, and the interpreter walks the
//! blocks itself once the program has halted
//! (`lean_vm::cpu::Program::execute`).
//!
//! Nothing in a block counts, tests, or allocates: a traversal of the size-`s` block
//! costs exactly `s + 1` rows, `s` of its table and one `JUMP`. That is where the sizes
//! earn their keep: powers of two make any fill reachable exactly, while the bulk rides
//! the largest block at one jump per 128 rows. A table already on a power of two is
//! never entered.
