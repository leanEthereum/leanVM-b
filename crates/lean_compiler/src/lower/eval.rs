//! Every function here takes `&self` and emits nothing, so asking costs nothing
//! and a `None` has committed the program to no answer.
//!
//! There are two answers and the POSITION of a use picks one:
//! [`FnLower::try_const_int`] for a size, an index, a bound or an exponent,
//! [`FnLower::try_field_const`] for a value, where `+` is XOR. They disagree on
//! a sum of overlapping integers, and `const(...)` is how an author says which
