//! Lowering: each function AST is compiled to a sequence of intermediate
//! [`LOp`] instructions (fp-relative offsets, backpatched jump targets).
//!
//! This file holds the walk itself, control flow, instruction emission, and
//! [`Scope`]. The rest is split by the question it answers, because each of the
//! four has an invariant worth stating once rather than rediscovering:
//!
//! - [`mod@eval`] asks what an expression is worth before anything runs. Every
//!   function there takes `&self` and emits nothing, which is what lets a caller
//!   ask without paying for the answer.
//! - [`mod@mem`] asks which cell a name means, and what writing to it costs.
//!   Every index is bounds-checked, in every position, and every store emits: the
//!   machine's write-once memory is what separates an assertion from a definition.
//! - [`mod@call`] is the call boundary. Caller and callee must agree on the
//!   arity, because they place the return area from their own idea of it.
//! - [`mod@builtins`] is the precompile and the hints: the two places a value
//!   arrives without an instruction computing it.
//!
//! [`Scope`] is what a name means HERE, and it reverts at a branch join, so a
//! cell whose `SET` sits inside a branch is never trusted outside it.
