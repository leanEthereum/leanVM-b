# zkDSL Language Reference (leanVM-b)

The zkDSL is a Python-syntax language that compiles to the leanVM-b ISA: six instructions (`XOR`, `MUL`, `SET`, `DEREF`, `JUMP`, `BLAKE2s`) over the binary field GF(2^192), with write-once memory and all indices carried "in the exponent" as powers of a fixed generator. For the underlying VM and proving system, see [`doc/leanvm/main.tex`](../../doc/leanvm/main.tex).

Source files use the `.py` extension and are **Python-shaped**: they import the [`snark_lib`](snark_lib.py) stub, which defines `GEN`, `log`, `mul_range`, `HeapBuf`, `StackBuf`, `assert_in_k`, and `blake2s`, so editors and linters resolve the intrinsic names. The compiler skips the import. Ordinary helpers such as `pack64x2` are defined in the single-file guest. A program that uses placeholders is not a runnable Python file: its `*_PLACEHOLDER` identifiers are undefined until the host fills them in, so importing it raises `NameError`.

Entry points: `lean_compiler::parse` / `parse_file_with_replacements` → `lean_compiler::compile` → `lean_vm::cpu::prove` / `verify`.

## Dev experience

The repo ships a root [`pyrightconfig.json`](../../pyrightconfig.json) with `"extraPaths": ["crates/lean_compiler"]`, so any `.py` program anywhere in the repo resolves `snark_lib` when the repo root is opened in the editor. A placeholder-free program also runs as plain Python (`PYTHONPATH=crates/lean_compiler python3 crates/lean_compiler/tests/programs/foo.py`); the stubs are no-ops, so this only checks that the file is well-formed.

## The field, and indices in the exponent

The fields are

`K = GF(2)[x]/(x^64 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)` and `E = K[y]/(y^3 + y + 1) = GF(2^192)`.

Machine **words** (the contents of a memory cell, an immediate, a hashed value, the `JUMP` condition) are elements of `E`. **Addresses**, the program counter, the frame pointer, read counters, operands, opcodes, and domain separators live in the 64-bit subfield `K = GF(2^64)`. There are no runtime integers.

- `+` is field addition = bitwise **XOR** (192-bit on words, so `x + x == 0`),
- `*` is multiplication in `E`; for g-powers and addresses it stays within `K`,
- `/` is runtime field division, `a / b = a · b⁻¹`. It costs one `MUL`: the compiler leaves the quotient cell unset and emits the checked relation `quotient · b == a`, which witness generation back-solves. Division by zero is undefined. This is distinct from `//`, compile-time integer floor division in sizes and indices,
- an integer literal `n` supplies up to 128 raw bits and is embedded as `F192(c0, c1, 0)`. This is a source-syntax limit, not the machine-word width: words have three 64-bit limbs. Thus `5` is `1 + x^2`, not the integer five, and the literal `18446744073709551616` is the tower element `y`. Written `2 ** 64` in a value position it is not: `**` there is a field power, so it is `x^64` reduced. `const(2 ** 64)` is the literal. Full-width constants use `f192(c0, c1, c2)`, with each limb an unsigned 64-bit compile-time integer,
- `GEN` is the fixed generator `g = x` of the 64-bit subfield `K^×` (multiplicative order `2^64 − 1`),
- `GEN ** e` is the compile-time constant `g^e ∈ K` (`**` takes base `GEN` and a compile-time integer exponent: a literal, a constant, an `unroll` variable, `len(...)`, or index arithmetic of those). So `buf[GEN ** i]` names heap cell `i` directly inside an `unroll` loop, with no running-pointer cursor.
- constant arithmetic means different things in the two positions, and this is a silent trap: `a + b` on two constants is **integer** addition in an index, a bound or a keyword (`buf[GEN ** (i + 1)]`, `unroll(0, n + 1)`, `counter=64 * (q + 1)`), and **XOR** in a value, where `1 + 1` is `0`. So a literal built in a value position must not add overlapping integers: `tweak = base + (level + 1) * SHIFT` drops the whole term on odd levels. Products are safe (an integer times a power of two is that shift, as long as the top bit stays inside the limb); to add, name the regime with `const(...)`: `tweak = base + const((level + 1) * SHIFT)`.
- a **global constant** and a **`Const` parameter** are integer-arithmetic throughout, which is deliberate (it is what makes a derived size right) but means the same text means different things in the two places: `STEP = 3 + 1` is the integer `4` everywhere it appears, while the identical `x = 3 + 1` written inside a function is the field element `2`. Neither is wrong; they are two regimes, and a name crossing between them is where the trap bites.
- a **compile-time `if`** must say which regime it means when the two disagree. The fold decides on the integer reading while the runtime test of the same condition compares field values, so `if 3 + 1 == 4` is true one way and false the other. Such a condition is **rejected**; write `if const(3 + 1 == 4):` to decide it with integer arithmetic, or spell the operands so the two readings agree (a product or a shift rather than a sum of overlapping integers). A condition whose readings already agree needs no wrapper.
- `base ** e` with a **non-`GEN`** base and a compile-time exponent `e` is square-and-multiply: integer arithmetic in an index/bound position (`2 ** c`), or field arithmetic in a value position (`x ** k`, e.g. a loop counter `g^i` raised to a stride to reach cell `i·stride`). The base may be runtime.

A logical **index** `i` is carried as `g^i` in the 64-bit subfield (order `2^64 − 1`): incrementing is one multiplication by `GEN`, and memory/bytecode addresses are g-powers. This is the design idiom of the whole VM: loops, heap addressing, and range checks below all live in the exponent, in `K`.

## Program shape

A program is a **single** `.py` file:

```python
from snark_lib import *   # for Python tooling; skipped by the compiler


def main():               # required entry point
    ...
    return

def helper(a, b):         # other functions
    ...
    return a * b
```

`import snark_lib` / `from snark_lib import *` are the only imports accepted; anything else is a compile error (no multi-file programs yet). Comments (`#`) and blank lines are free. Indentation is block structure, as in Python.

Ordinary functions may return scalars, `HeapBuf` pointers, and `StackBuf` values, including mixtures in a tuple return. A returned `StackBuf(n)` has a compile-time-known size: its `n` cells are copied through `n` consecutive return slots and the caller binds the result as a new `StackBuf(n)`. A `HeapBuf` return is just its one-cell pointer; the allocation hint already ran where the buffer was created, so no size metadata needs to cross the call.

## Public input

Memory cells `m[0]` and `m[1]` hold the two public-input words, each an F192 machine word. A program *publishes* results by asserting them against those cells through the write-once heap store (the pointer `g^0` addresses absolute memory):

```python
p = GEN ** 0
p[1] = result_a     # m[p·1]  = m[0], an equality assert against the public input
p[GEN] = result_b   # m[p·g] = m[1]
```

Test programs under `tests/programs/` declare the public input they expect with a top-of-file annotation of two constant elements (or omit it to run with two zeros); the generic harness `tests/py_source.rs` proves and verifies every program in the directory:

```python
# public_input: GEN ** 89, 101229015297003380629709256178361811305
```

## Global constants and placeholders

Above the functions (after the optional `snark_lib` import) a program may declare **global constants**, top-level `NAME = <const-expr>`:

```python
from snark_lib import *

N = 8                    # an integer size / value
STEP = GEN ** 2          # a g-power constant (index carried in the exponent)
WIDE = N + 1             # compile-time INTEGER arithmetic (`+ - * / **`);
                         # references to *earlier* constants are allowed

def main():
    buf = StackBuf(N)    # a constant is a plain literal: usable as a size,
    x = GEN ** N         # a `**` exponent, a stack/slice index, an operand,
    assert log x < N     # an `assert log _ < _` bound, or a `Const` argument
    return
```

Each constant is **evaluated as a compile-time integer expression** (or an `f192` literal, or a field-valued one such as `GEN ** 2`) and substituted as a single literal everywhere its name appears below, so unlike a `Const` parameter it needs no call site and works in every literal position. Integer arithmetic is the point: it is what makes a derived size come out right, as in `N_TWEAK_WORDS = 2 + CHAIN_STEPS * V + LOG_LIFETIME`. Constants must precede the `def`s and are resolved *before* variables, so a constant name is **reserved**: do not reuse it as a parameter or local name. (Syntactically, `N = 8` is just a Python module global.)

**Placeholders** let a host fill values at compile time without editing the source. Any identifier may be mapped to replacement text before parsing (`parse_with_replacements` / `parse_file_with_replacements`, taking a `BTreeMap<String, String>`); the replacement is identifier-bounded (`FOO` does not touch `FOOBAR`). The idiom is a placeholder feeding a constant:

```python
V = V_PLACEHOLDER        # with replacement  "V_PLACEHOLDER" ↦ "128"
LOG_LIFETIME = LOG_LIFETIME_PLACEHOLDER

def main():
    ...                  # V is the constant 128 throughout
```

so one source template compiles at many sizes. An unfilled placeholder (no replacement, no matching constant) is a compile error, not a silent variable.

### Constant arrays

A global constant may be a **list literal**, `NAME = [a, b, c]`, of compile-time values (integers or field values, each a `<const-expr>`). Unlike a scalar constant it is **not** textually substituted; it is carried to lowering and consumed at compile time:

```python
QUERIES = [290, 177, 145]          # or QUERIES = QUERIES_PLACEHOLDER, filled "[290, 177, 145]"
Z       = [Z0_PLACEHOLDER, Z1_PLACEHOLDER, Z2_PLACEHOLDER]   # arbitrary field values

def main():
    for lvl in unroll(0, len(QUERIES)):     # len(NAME) is a compile-time count
        n = QUERIES[lvl]                     # NAME[i] with a compile-time index i
        row = buf[GEN ** QUERIES[lvl]]       #   (i a literal / constant / unroll var)
        ...
```

`NAME[i]` yields the element (as a field value in value position, or as an integer where an index / slice bound / `unroll` count / `**` exponent is expected), and `len(NAME)` its length. The index `i` must be compile-time (a literal, a constant, or an `unroll` variable). This is what lets one source file adapt to a per-level config vector (query counts, fold factors, sizes) without Rust-side code generation. Nested lists are not (yet) supported: flatten a 2-D table into one array plus an offsets array.

## Functions

```python
def f(a, b):
    return a + b, a * b   # multiple returns

x, y = f(p, q)            # tuple assignment
z = f(p, q)               # expression position: first return
f(p, q)                   # statement: returns discarded
```

Functions may recurse. Each call gets a **fresh frame**: the frame pointer is prover-hinted (write-once memory makes an unconstrained cell prover-chosen), arguments and the return address/frame are stored with `DEREF`s, and control transfers with one `JUMP`. Cost: about `n_args + n_returns + 4` instructions per call. Every non-`main` function must end in an explicit `return`; in `main`, `return` is a no-op (main halts at a sentinel automatically).

### `StackBuf` parameters

```python
def compress(cv: StackBuf(2), block: StackBuf(2)):
    out = StackBuf(2)
    blake2s(cv, block, out)
    return out
```

`s: StackBuf(n)` marks a parameter as a **run of n cells**, passed whole. The caller must pass a `StackBuf` of exactly that size (a whole named one: a slice is not yet accepted), and the run is copied into the callee's frame.

Those cells arrive **already written**, unlike a local `StackBuf`'s, so a store into one is the write-once equality *assertion* rather than a fresh store. That is what makes a callee able to pin its caller's values: `s[k] = <checked value>` inside the callee asserts that the caller's cell already held it. It also means a run parameter initializes nothing, so passing a partly-written buffer passes its unwritten cells, which the prover then chooses, exactly as anywhere else.

A `match` arm cannot pass one: the fused dispatch writes one cell per argument, so give such arms `Const` arguments and let each specialize instead. This is otherwise the same mechanism a `StackBuf` **return** already used, in the other direction: the argument area is a width rather than a count, and a run occupies the cells its size asks for. Without it a two-cell value could come out of a function whole but only go in through a `HeapBuf` pointer or an `@inline` expansion, which grows the caller's frame at every call site.

### `Const` parameters

```python
def hash_pair(buf, k: Const):
    h = StackBuf(2)
    blake2s(buf[k * 2:k * 2 + 2], buf[k * 2:k * 2 + 2], h)
    return h[0], h[1]
```

`k: Const` marks a **compile-time parameter**: the call site must pass a constant (an integer literal, `GEN ** k`, or a literal-bound name), and the compiler *specializes* the function per distinct constant tuple, a monomorphized copy (`hash_pair__L1`) with the parameter substituted as its literal, shared by every call with the same constants; only the runtime arguments are passed. Inside the body the parameter *is* the literal, so it works in compile-time positions: stack indexes, slice bounds. A function with a `Const` parameter is a template: it is never lowered itself. The idiomatic pairing dispatches a runtime index to a const-indexed helper:

```python
r = match(log(x), range(0, 4), lambda i: hash_pair(buf, i))
```

### `@inline`: inline a function at its call sites

```python
@inline
def combine(a, b, k: Const):
    s = StackBuf(2)
    if k % 2 == 0:      # a folded `if` (see below): baked per Const value
        s[0] = a
    else:
        s[0] = b
    s[1] = a + b
    return s[k % 2]
```

An `@inline` function is **expanded at each call site** instead of emitting a real call: no frame, no argument/return `DEREF`s, no call/return `JUMP`s. The body must be a single **tail** `return`; it may contain builtins, calls to other `@inline` functions, `if`, and `unroll`, but not a call to a non-inline user function, a `for`/`match`, or any nested/early `return`. Nested inline calls expand recursively; direct or indirect recursive inline calls are rejected. An inline function is never lowered standalone; a call to a non-`@inline` function is unchanged. (Distinct from `unroll(a, b)`, which replicates a loop body: that one really does unroll.)

An `@inline` function may also **return a `StackBuf`**: the caller's binding aliases the returned cell run (zero copies), and `StackBuf` arguments alias likewise. This makes chained-state helpers free, the MD-chain idiom:

```python
@inline
def obs(cb, x):          # Fiat-Shamir absorb: cb <- compress(cb, (x, SCALAR))
    tg = [x, DS_OBSERVE]  # a list literal: an initialized StackBuf(2)
    nb = StackBuf(2)
    blake2s(cb, tg, nb)
    return nb            # the call site's `cvb = obs(cvb, v)` aliases nb

cvb = obs(cvb, v)        # exactly 3 ops: two tag writes + one blake2s
```

An `@inline` call may also sit in **expression position**: embedded in arithmetic, as a store's RHS, or as a single-target `match` arm. An aliased return (a folded g-address) then materializes into a plain cell (free for a var; one `MUL` for a shifted pointer); a multi-cell `StackBuf` return still needs a `let` binding, since only a name can alias a cell run.

An `@inline` function that also takes a `Const` parameter and is used as a `match` arm is specialized rather than expanded: the fused dispatch enters one real function, so `@inline` is simply not honoured there. One without a `Const` parameter has no entry to dispatch to and is rejected.

Because the body runs in the *caller's* frame, a `Const` parameter whose `if`s fold (below) bakes straight-line, per-case code, the idiom for a `match` arm that must specialize on the arm value. The trade-off is frame cells: each call site gets its own copy, so `@inline` pays off for small, hot callees; inlining a large body at many sites grows the committed witness (more data memory), so it is opt-in, not automatic.

## Variables

Bindings are **immutable**: `x = e` names a fresh cell. Re-binding a name is allowed (it's a new cell; the old value is unaffected), but there is no mutation. Compound assignment (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `//=`, `%=`) is sugar for a re-binding: `x += e` desugars to `x = x + e`.

A name bound to an integer literal (`x = 2`) additionally acts as a **compile-time index constant**, usable in stack indexes and slice bounds (see below). Any other re-binding clears that role.

Two families of binding are folded and carried **virtually**, costing no instruction until used as a value:

- **g-powers and shifted pointers**: a cursor like `s = s * GEN` or a pointer view `p = buf * GEN ** k`. The offset folds into the `DEREF` address of each access; only a scalar use materializes it.
- **field constants**: a value built from literals / `GEN ** k` by field `+` and `*`, e.g. a running weight `w = w * CHAIN_LENGTH` in an unrolled loop. The arithmetic that advances it is compile-time (zero instructions); each use is one `SET` of the folded constant.
A store into a stack cell is NOT virtual: `sa[k] = other` always emits. If the cell already holds a value the store is the write-once equality *assertion* below, which is what makes `s[k] = <checked value>` pin a hint and a pre-written `blake2s` output verify a digest; if it does not, the store is what gives the cell its value. The compiler tracks nothing to tell those apart, the machine's write-once memory being what distinguishes them.

## Debugging

`print(expr)` / `print("label", expr)` displays a value at witness generation (prover side only, with no constraints and nothing entering the transcript). The label defaults to the argument's source text; output goes to stderr as `[print] label = ...`, showing the decimal reading for small integers, `g^k` when the value is a small g-power (both when they overlap: `8 (g^3)`), or `c2:c1:c0` hex otherwise, from the most significant limb to the least significant. Each print costs one anchor instruction, so the witness differs from a print-free build: strip prints before benchmarking.

## Memory

All memory is **write-once**: a cell is set once; a second write of the same value is a no-op, of a different value a proof failure. This turns stores into equality assertions and is used throughout (publishing, `blake2s` outputs). Reading a cell nobody ever writes yields an unconstrained value (fixed to zero at the end of witness generation): don't.

### `HeapBuf(n)`: heap buffers, indexed in the exponent

```python
buf = HeapBuf(4)      # fresh, disjoint region; `buf` is its pointer (a g-power)
buf[1] = 5            # m[buf·1]   is cell g^0
buf[GEN] = 7          # m[buf·g]   is cell g^1
v = buf[i]            # m[buf·i], i any runtime g-power (e.g. a loop counter)
buf[i * GEN] = v      # the next cell along
```

The index is a field element; cell `k` of the buffer lives at address `buf · g^k`. A read or store is one `DEREF`. A **runtime** index costs one extra `MUL` for the `buf·i` pointer, but a **compile-time g-power** offset (`buf[1]`, `buf[GEN ** k]`, or a cursor advanced by `× GEN ** m`) folds into the `DEREF`'s address immediate for free: no `MUL`, no `SET`, and the cursor arithmetic itself vanishes (so a `× GEN` walk over consecutive cells is zero instructions).

**Compile-time indices are bounds-checked.** When the whole index is a compile-time exponent and the pointer resolves to a declared `HeapBuf` (directly, or through shifted aliases like `row = buf * GEN ** k`), the compiler rejects `index >= size`, and the same for the spans of `hint_witness` and `blake2s` slices. **Runtime** indices are not checked (their value is unknown at compile time): there the buffer remains a region convention, and a stray access surfaces at proving time as a write-once conflict or wild deref.

### `StackBuf(n)`: frame-cell runs, indexed by compile-time integers

```python
sa = StackBuf(3)      # n consecutive cells of the current frame
sa[0] = 3             # direct frame cell: no DEREF, but the store is an instruction
sa[2] = sa[0] + sa[1]
x = 1
v = sa[x + 1]         # indexes: literals, literal-bound names, and + * // % of those
tg = [v, 7]           # list literal: an initialized StackBuf, one cell per element
```

A **list literal** `x = [a, b, …]` is an initialized `StackBuf`: it allocates one cell per element and writes each element in place, exactly the alloc-then-store idiom above, in one line. Elements are arbitrary runtime expressions; each write goes through the same stack-store path. It exists only as the RHS of a plain assignment inside a function; a *top-level* `NAME = [...]` is a constant array (see "Constant arrays"). The elements are lowered before the name rebinds, so `s = [s[1], s[0]]` swaps through the old binding.

Stack indexes and slice bounds are **compile-time integers**, and index arithmetic (`+ * // %`) is *integer* arithmetic (`x + 1` above is 2, `k // 2` floor-divides, `k % 2` is a remainder: index space, not the field, where XOR is what `+` means and `//`/`%` have no meaning at all: using one as a runtime field value is a compile error). Bounds are checked at compile time. A `StackBuf` name is a run of cells, not a scalar: using it as one is an error, and it cannot be captured into a `for` loop body (carry state through a `HeapBuf` instead).

`p = addr(sb)` names the run's first cell as a **pointer** (`GEN ** k` times the frame pointer), so `p[i]` reads the same cells at a runtime index, `p` can be passed to a callee or stored, and `sb[k]` stays a direct frame cell throughout. Only valid as a whole right-hand side. It costs one materialization of `fp` per function (2 `DEREF`s, amortized with `if`'s; free in `main`), which is the price of the ISA having no fp-read. This is what lets a bit buffer live in the frame and still be walked by a `mul_range` loop.

A runtime index through such a pointer is unchecked, as on the heap, but it fails more quietly: every frame cell is a real cell, so `p[i]` with a hinted `i` reaches any of them and usually neither faults nor conflicts. The program owes the range check itself (`assert log i < n`) wherever `i` is not a loop counter the compiler produced.

### Slices: `buf[lo:hi]`

`buf[lo:hi]` names a run of cells (`hi` exclusive). BLAKE2s operands must span exactly two cells; `hint_witness` accepts any supported literal length. Two forms:

- **compile-time bounds** (integers, as for stack indexes): frame cells `base+lo .. base+hi` of a `StackBuf`, or heap cells `ptr·g^lo .. ptr·g^hi` of a `HeapBuf`, so `hb[2:4]` is the pair `g^2, g^3`;
- **runtime start, heap only**: `buf[i:i + k]` with a runtime g-power index `i` (e.g. a loop counter) and literal length `k` names the cells `buf·i`, `buf·i·g`, and so on; one `MUL` folds `i` into the pointer. The `hi` bound cannot be evaluated, only shape-checked: it must be syntactically `lo + k` (`buf[b * GEN ** 2 : b * GEN ** 2 + 2]` is fine). A `StackBuf` slice cannot have a runtime start: frame offsets are baked into the bytecode operands.

Note the two index spaces, consistent with plain indexing: compile-time bounds are integer exponents (`hb[2:4]` ≡ `hb[GEN ** 2 : GEN ** 2 + 2]`), runtime starts are g-power elements.

## Control flow

### `for i in mul_range(start, stop)`: loops in the exponent

```python
for i in mul_range(1, GEN ** 10):   # i = g^0, g^1, …, g^9
    buf[i * GEN * GEN] = buf[i] * buf[i * GEN]
```

The counter walks multiplicatively: it starts at `start`, advances by `×GEN` each iteration, and stops on reaching `stop` (exclusive). The start is a compile-time power of `GEN` (`1`, `GEN`, or `GEN ** k`); the stop is either compile-time too (an empty range compiles to nothing) or a **runtime** g-power element, e.g. a hinted count:

```python
hint_witness(nb[0:1], "n_blocks")
n = nb[0]
assert log(n) < 16       # the walk terminates only by REACHING the bound:
for j in mul_range(1, n):   # bound its log first, or it never does
    ...
```

A runtime bound is evaluated once at entry and threaded through the loop as an extra parameter (+1 argument per iteration call); entry itself is the same `!=` test, so a bound equal to the start runs zero iterations.

Lowering: the body becomes a tail-recursive helper function whose exit test is folded into the recursion's `JUMP` condition: one call per iteration, no separate is-zero gadget. Free variables of the body are captured **by value** as extra parameters; a `HeapBuf` pointer threads through fine, a `StackBuf` does not (compile error).

### `for i in unroll(a, b)`: compile-time unrolling

```python
for i in unroll(0, 7):
    sb[i + 1] = sb[i] * GEN          # i is the integer literal of each copy

def chain(buf, n: Const):
    for i in unroll(0, n):           # a Const parameter as a bound
        blake2s(buf[i * 2:i * 2 + 2], buf[i * 2:i * 2 + 2], buf[i * 2 + 2:i * 2 + 4])
    return
```

The body is replicated `b − a` times with `i` substituted by each integer literal in turn, usable anywhere a literal is (stack indexes, slice bounds, `Const` arguments). Zero loop overhead: no call, no frame, no counter; the price is code size. Bounds are compile-time integer expressions, evaluated after `Const` specialization, so `unroll(0, n)` with `n: Const` works (unlike `mul_range`, whose bounds are parse-time literals). Every copy executes (this is straight-line code, not a branch), so bindings simply rebind, a fresh binding per iteration.

### `if` / `elif` / `else`

```python
if x == GEN ** 3:
    r[1] = 5
elif x != y:
    r[1] = 7
else:
    r[1] = 9
```

Conditions are field-equality tests: `a == b` or `a != b` (there are no other predicates: order facts come from range-check asserts). The lowering is one `XOR` plus one conditional `JUMP` on it; the taken jump goes to whichever block the test doesn't fall into, so no negation gadget is needed. An `elif` is sugar for an `else` holding a nested `if`.

When **both sides are compile-time integers** (e.g. after a `Const` parameter is substituted, `if k % 2 == 0:`), the condition is known at compile time and the `if` **folds** to just the taken branch: no `XOR`, no `JUMP`, no `self-fp`. This is what lets an `@inline` function bake different straight-line code per `Const` value. A side whose integer reading and field reading disagree (`3 + 1` is the integer 4 and the field element 2) is **rejected** rather than folded either way, since the fold and a runtime test of the same condition would answer differently; write `if const(...)` below to decide it with integer arithmetic. Note that the rejection is per side, so it fires however the OTHER side is spelled.

Two write-once-flavored rules:

- **bindings made inside a branch are local to it**: the compile-time scope reverts at the join. Branches communicate through memory: only one branch executes, so both may write the *same* cell (`r[1]` above), and the join reads it.
- a cell nobody wrote (e.g. skipped-branch territory) stays unconstrained, the same rule as everywhere else in write-once memory.

Local jumps must carry the frame pointer, which the ISA cannot read directly; each branching function materializes its own `fp` once (2 `DEREF`s through a 1-cell heap bounce; free in `main`, where `fp = g^0 = 1`).

### `match`

```python
r = match(log(x), range(0, 6), lambda j: f(j))
a, b = match(log(x), range(0, 2), lambda j: g(1), range(2, 6), lambda j: g(j))
```

The one dispatch construct. It matches the **log** of a g-power scrutinee against integer arms, which must cover consecutive integers from 0 (the dispatch table is dense; there is no default arm). Arm `j` is the lambda body with the parameter replaced by the **integer literal** `j`, usable as a field constant or a compile-time index, expanded at parse time over the contiguous `(range, lambda)` pairs. The whole call sits on one line, there being no line continuation.

Arms produce VALUES: every arm writes its results into the same cells, which is sound under write-once because exactly one arm runs. A target may be a name, bound after the join, or a **`StackBuf` element**, which the arms write into directly and which costs one instruction less than a name plus a store. The ABI returns into cells the CALLER picks, the same reason `sb[i] = f(x)` never needed a temporary, so reach for the element form wherever a returned value's home is a buffer slot. A target index must be a compile-time integer inside the buffer, both errors naming the line; a `HeapBuf` element is not a target, its cells not being frame cells. Multiple targets take a multi-return call as the arm body.

A branch body with statements in it goes in a function, and the arm calls it: that is the idiom the recursion guest uses throughout (`lambda k: walk(chain_start, tweaks, pp, k)`), and it names the body instead of inlining it. Where the arms only PRODUCE values, as there, this costs nothing. Where each arm's real work is a WRITE, it costs: the writer function needs a return value and the statement a target, both dead, and the natural translation measures about twice the instructions of a body inlined into the dispatching frame. An arm cannot take a `StackBuf` parameter either, so it cannot hash or hint into the caller's frame buffer. If that shape matters to a program, dispatch on a value and write after the join.

**Lowering** is two jumps through a *trampoline table* in the bytecode: the dispatch jumps to `g^T · x²`, the j-th two-instruction slot (`SET` the arm's address, `JUMP` to it) of a table at base `T`, and the slot jumps to the arm, which can sit anywhere, unaligned and of any length. Cost is about 7 cycles, independent of the arm count.

(Why not leanVM's single-jump `pc = a + b·x`: that affine address needs integer *scaling* by the common block size `b`, which in the exponent becomes `x^b`, log₂ b squarings, plus padding every block to the longest; the trampoline collapses the aligned region to 2-instruction slots, so the scaling is the single squaring `x²`. Other layouts exist, e.g. a memory-resident address table dispatched with a single jump, worthwhile for many repeated small matches, but only the trampoline is implemented.)

**Soundness**: nothing in the dispatch bounds `x`, so a scrutinee outside `[0, n)` jumps to an arbitrary pc. A hinted value must be range-checked first (`assert log(x) < n`, 3 cycles), as in leanVM.

**Dispatched-call fusion.** When *every* arm is a call to the same function with identical runtime arguments (the common `lambda k: f(a, b, k)`, where only a `Const` argument varies), the compiler builds the callee frame **once** and the dispatch jumps straight into the selected specialization's entry, which returns past the join. Each taken arm is then just the trampoline's two instructions (`SET entry; JUMP`) instead of a full call: no per-arm frame setup, call jump, or return jump. (The `walk`-per-digit dispatch in the XMSS verifier is the motivating case.)

Statements without effect are rejected.

### `if const(...)`: a branch decided while compiling

```python
if const(level + 1 == DEPTH):   # decided now, with integer arithmetic
    tail = 0
```

Wrapping a condition in `const(...)` asks for the branch to be decided while compiling. Two things follow. The condition must be decidable then, so both sides must be compile-time integers, and a runtime one is an error rather than a silent fallback to a runtime test. And it is read with **integer** arithmetic, the regime a compile-time constant lives in, which is what makes `const(...)` the answer when a condition's two readings disagree (see "The field, and indices in the exponent").

A folded branch emits no test and no jump, and its body is straight-line code, so **its bindings outlive it** where a runtime branch's are branch-local. That is the other reason to reach for the wrapper: it states that the arm's bindings are meant to escape.

A plain `if` still folds on its own when both sides are compile-time integers and neither side's two readings disagree, so the wrapper is needed only where one does, where the condition is decidable only in the field (`GEN ** 3 == GEN ** 3`, which a plain `if` lowers to a real runtime branch), or where you want the compiler to insist.

### `const(...)` in a value position

```python
tweak = TW_NODE + const((level + 1) * P_MUL) + tau   # (level+1)*P_MUL as integers
```

The same wrapper, the same meaning: read this with **integer** arithmetic and emit the literal. It is needed because `+` in a value position is XOR, so `level + 1` with `level = 3` is 2 rather than 4, and silently: the value is well-formed, just not the one the arithmetic reads like. `-`, `//` and `%` have no field meaning at all, so `const(...)` is the only way to write them in a value position.

The inner expression must be a compile-time integer (a literal, a global constant, a `Const` parameter, an `unroll` counter, a name bound to one, a constant-array element, and `+ - * // % **` of those), and one that is not says so rather than falling back to a runtime computation. The result is one pooled `SET`, so a repeat costs nothing.

In a position that is ALREADY integer arithmetic (a size, a count, an exponent, a bound, a stack index, a global constant) the wrapper is transparent: it asks for the only reading there is, so it changes nothing and is allowed rather than redundant. Where it earns its keep is a value, a condition, and anywhere `-`, `//` or `%` has to appear.

The wrapper reinterprets the **operators**, not the leaves, and that is the whole of its meaning. Two consequences. A leaf whose own two readings disagree is rejected rather than silently read one way, so `n = 2 + 3` (the cell holds `2 XOR 3` = 1, the name's integer reading is 5) may not appear inside one: bind it in one regime and name that one. And the arithmetic runs on a leaf's **bit pattern**, so an element of a field-valued constant array is read as the integer those bits spell, which is not what field arithmetic on it would give: `const(TABLE[i] * 2)` doubles the bit pattern where `TABLE[i] * 2` is a field product.

## Assertions

### `assert a == b`

A proof-enforced equality: 1 cycle (`XOR` into the frame's zero cell, whose write-once double write is the assert).

### `assert a != b`

A proof-enforced inequality, in **3 instructions and no branch**: `XOR` for `x = a + b`, a prover-hinted `inv = x⁻¹`, then `MUL p = x·inv` and `SET p = 1`, where the write-once conflict is the assertion, exactly as for `assert a == b`. It is sound because `x = 0` forces `p = 0` whatever the prover hints, and `p` cannot then also be `1`; the hint needs no checking of its own, which is why an unconstrained value is safe here. Since there is no `JUMP` there is no self-frame or branch setup to amortize either. A compile-time assertion such as `assert 5 != 5` is rejected while compiling.

### Range checks: `assert log x < log Y` and `assert log x < k`

The *range check in the exponent*: proves `x ∈ {g^0, g^1, …, g^{k-1}}`, i.e. `log_g(x) < k`. A compile-time bound is either `log GEN ** k` or a plain integer exponent `k`, with `1 ≤ k ≤ 2^16` (the minimum memory size, which keeps the gadget provable at every memory size the prover may announce). `log x` and `log(x)` both parse; the parenthesized form is the valid-Python spelling. A bare `assert x < y` is rejected: field elements have no order, only their logs do.

```python
assert log(x) < log(GEN ** 8)
assert log(x) < 8               # the same check
assert log(x) < log(n)          # n = g^k runtime: same gadget, +1 cycle
```

A **runtime** bound costs one extra `MUL` for `g^{k-1} = n·g⁻¹` and is otherwise identical, except that the `k ≤ 2^16` cap becomes the program's to enforce: range-check the bound itself first, with `assert log n < 2^16`. That check is not optional: without it the gadget is unsound.

Cost: **3 cycles** (leanVM's DEREF range-check trick, in the exponent) plus one amortized `SET` per distinct bound per frame:

1. `DEREF` through `x`: the dereferenced address must be one of the memory's `2^h` g-power addresses, so the memory bus itself proves `x = g^e`, `e < 2^h`;
2. `MUL x·y` into the write-once cell holding `g^{k-1}`: the runner back-solves the complement `y = g^{k-1-e}` (the one unknown operand of a known product), and the double-write asserts `x·y = g^{k-1}`;
3. `DEREF` through `y`: bounds the complement; a "negative" `k-1-e` would wrap to `≈ 2^64`, far beyond any memory size, so together `e ≤ k-1`.

The two `DEREF` target cells are unconstrained touches, back-filled at the end of execution. A failing check surfaces at witness generation as the complement's `DEREF` panic ("not a small g-power … a failed range check").

## K membership and packing

```python
assert_in_k(lo, hi)
```

`assert_in_k(a, b)` is the sole packing-related compiler intrinsic. It proves that both source memory words are in the base field GF(2^64) with one untaken `JUMP`: its condition is a known zero, while its destination and frame operands are `a` and `b`. Although neither value affects the successor state, both memory reads carry literal-zero upper limbs, so a source outside GF(2^64) cannot balance the memory permutation.

Packing is ordinary zkDSL built on that assertion:

```python
@inline
def pack64x2(a, b):
    assert_in_k(a, b)
    return a + f192(0, 1, 0) * b
```

The inline helper takes three cycles, one `JUMP`, one `MUL` and one `XOR`, and returns the canonical 128-bit packing `(a.c0, b.c0, 0)`. Assignment-target lowering writes its return directly into the destination, including an already-written cell whose second write is an equality assertion. A caller needing only membership uses `assert_in_k` directly and pays no packing arithmetic.

The recursion transcript uses `challenge_from_state(state)` to reinterpret the first three 64-bit lanes of a canonical two-cell BLAKE2s digest as one extension field challenge. For `state = [s0, s1]`, it lowers exactly as follows (the limb hints cost no cycles, but are not trusted):

```python
d2 = StackBuf(1)
hint_f192_limbs(d2, state[1])
d3 = (state[1] + d2[0]) * Y_INV
assert_in_k(d2[0], d3)
challenge = state[0] + d2[0] * f192(0, 0, 1)
```

Both state words are BLAKE2s outputs, so their top limbs are already zero. Only `d2` must be exposed separately; deriving `d3 = (s1+d2)/Y` and proving both values lie in GF(2^64) binds the one hinted limb by uniqueness of the tower representation. The challenge is `s0+d2·Y² = d0+d1·Y+d2·Y²`, while `d3` is checked but deliberately discarded. `challenge_from_state` is not a compiler intrinsic: this is the complete `@inline` helper used by the recursion guest.

Likewise, the recursion guest's `fs_compress(state, scalar, tail, out)` is ordinary straight-line zkDSL:

```python
limbs = StackBuf(3)
hint_f192_limbs(limbs, scalar)  # advice: scalar's three K coordinates
block = StackBuf(2)
block[0] = pack64x2(limbs[0], limbs[1])
block[1] = pack64x2(limbs[2], tail)
assert scalar == limbs[0] + Y * (limbs[1] + Y * limbs[2])
blake2s(state, block, out)
```

The first two packing helpers range-check all four serialized lanes and form the exact 64-byte BLAKE2s block `[scalar.c0, scalar.c1, scalar.c2, tail]`; the equality prevents the advice from changing `scalar`. The final row is the VM's sole, canonical `BLAKE2s` instruction.

## BLAKE2s

```python
h = StackBuf(2)
blake2s(a, b, h)                    # digest of (a, b) written into h
blake2s(t[0:2], t[x:x + 2], t[4:6])  # slices of one large StackBuf
blake2s(h, hb[0:2], hb[2:4])         # HeapBuf slices, input and output
blake2s(hb[i:i + 2], h, hb[j:j + 2])  # runtime-indexed heap slices (i, j g-powers)

# A standard 80-byte hash as two blocks. Keyword values are compile-time.
block0 = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # 64 bytes
tail = [5, 0, 0, 0]    # 16 more, the rest of the block zero-filled
blake2s(block0[0:2], block0[2:4], cv, counter=64, final=0)
blake2s(tail[0:2], tail[2:4], out, cv=cv, counter=80, final=1)
```

The three positional arguments form a **statement**: one standard BLAKE2s compression consumes the two 256-bit message operands `a`, `b` (64 bytes) and writes its 32-byte result into the 2-cell run `out`. With no keywords it computes the standard hash of exactly 64 bytes: the parameterized BLAKE2s-256 initial chaining value (digest length 32, unkeyed, fanout and depth 1), byte counter 64, final-block flag `f0` set. That is `blake2s(a || b)`, the form every Fiat-Shamir step and Merkle node uses.

Every compression also has a 256-bit chaining value and a 128-bit metadata word. BLAKE2s takes the byte counter and the two flags as ordinary compression inputs, which is why one instruction is a complete hash of any length and there is no chunk tree to drive (see `primitives::hash`). The optional keywords are:

- `cv=<pair>`: a consecutive 2-cell chaining value, the previous block's output; omitting it selects the parameterized IV above. On each runtime path, a function emits two `SET`s at its first such hash only and reuses those cells thereafter. Supplying `cv=` also requires one of the three below, since a chained block is never the default one-block hash;
- `counter=<u64>`: BLAKE2s's byte counter `t`, **cumulative** through this block, so `64 * whole_blocks_before + bytes_in_this_block`. Defaults to 64;
- `final=<0|1>`: BLAKE2s's final-block flag `f0`. It defaults to 1 for the bare three-argument call, but to **0** as soon as `counter=` or `last_node=` appears, so a chained hash must set `final=1` on its last block and a single short block needs `counter=<len>, final=1`. Any compile-time expression works, nonzero meaning set, which is what lets the guests write a predicate like `final=(q + 1) // BLOCKS_PER_HASH`;
- `last_node=<0|1>`: BLAKE2s's tree-mode flag `f1`. Defaults to 0, and nothing here uses tree mode.

The metadata is packed as `counter:u64 | f0:u32 | f1:u32`, little-endian, into one memory cell the instruction reads, like every other operand. With compile-time keywords that cell is one pooled `SET`: a frame emits it once per distinct metadata value, however many compressions read it, and the immediate that wrote it is public bytecode. There is no block-length field: the counter is what states how many of the 64 bytes are message, so only the last block may be partial and the program must zero-fill the bytes past its real length, which the compression circuit does not enforce. A multi-block hash therefore feeds each result back with `cv=`, advances `counter=` by the bytes actually absorbed, and sets `final=1` on the last block.

Operands are size-2 `StackBuf`s or 2-cell slices:

- an **input operand written as a list**, `blake2s([a, b], [c, d], out)`, names its two words directly and allocates nothing: the opcode addresses its four input chunks independently, so an operand whose words live in different places never has to be gathered into a consecutive run. This is the spelling to reach for instead of `p = StackBuf(2); p[0] = a; p[1] = b`;
- **stack operands** are read in place, at zero copies; a self-hash `blake2s(h, h, out)` names one 2-cell pair as both inputs;
- the instruction addresses its **four canonical 128-bit message chunks independently** (each is a full F192 memory cell constrained at this use to the BLAKE2s subspace `c2 = 0`), so an operand gathered into a buffer (`p = StackBuf(2); p[0] = t0; p[1] = t1; blake2s(p, …)`) costs one instruction per assembling store, which the list form above avoids entirely;
- the chaining value has only one opcode offset and therefore must be consecutive. If a 2-cell `cv` was assembled from non-adjacent copied cells, the compiler materializes those two cells into a fresh consecutive run;
- **heap slices** are still bridged through the stack for the *input pull* (the operand's words come from the heap): +1 `DEREF` per heap cell, and the output, if a heap slice, is stored after: write-once memory fills whichever side is unset.

If `out` was already written, the statement *asserts* the digest equals it, write-once turning the hash into a verification, which is exactly what a signature verifier wants.

The compression, including its chaining value and metadata, is proven by the flock-derived BLAKE2s R1CS (`crates/flock`, see `doc.pdf` §BLAKE2s); one instruction is one 64-byte-block compression.

## Hints: `hint_witness(dest, "name")`

```python
sb = StackBuf(2)
hint_witness(sb, "r")        # fill the whole StackBuf
hint_witness(hb[0:3], "h")   # or any StackBuf/HeapBuf slice (any length)
assert log(sb[0]) < 8        # hinted values are UNCONSTRAINED: pin them down
```

A single hinted value needs no destination at all:

```python
m = hint_witness("m")        # one value, bound to a name
assert log m < 8             # still unconstrained: pin it
```

which is the one-line form of allocating a `StackBuf(1)`, filling a slice of it, and reading the cell back out, and costs exactly the same (nothing). Everything below about a stream's entries applies to it: each such binding pops one entry, whose length must be 1.

Prover-supplied data (leanVM's `hint_witness`): a stream is a sequence of **entries**, one slice of values per `hint_witness` call, and the same symbol may be hinted many times. Each call pops the stream's next entry (whose length must match the destination run) and writes it into `dest` through the hint mechanism, at **zero cycles**. The values are completely unconstrained; the program must constrain them itself (asserts, range checks, hashes): an unconstrained hint consumed by anything security-relevant is a critical vulnerability. Runtime-start heap slices (`buf[i:i + k]`, `k` a literal) work too.

The prover supplies streams with `program.set_witness("name", entries)` (`Vec<Vec<extension-field>>`); test programs declare them as annotations, one line per entry, and repeated lines with the same name are its successive entries:

```python
# witness r: GEN ** 5, 12
# witness r: 9
```

### Computed-advice hints

Three builtins have the prover compute the values at witness generation instead of popping a stream entry. Like `hint_witness`, the results are completely unconstrained: the program must re-verify them in-circuit.

- `hint_decompose_bits(bits, value, nbits)`: writes the low `nbits` bits of `value` into the buffer `bits`, one field element (`0`/`1`) per bit.
- `hint_decompose_bits_exponent(bits, x, nbits)`: writes the `nbits` bits of the exponent `n` where `x = GEN ** n` into `bits` (a bounded dlog at witness generation).
- `g = hint_log2_ceil(bits, nbits, floor)`: returns `GEN ** log2_ceil(v)` for the value `v` held bitwise in the `nbits`-bit buffer `bits`, floored at `floor`.

`bits` is a `HeapBuf` or a `StackBuf` (of at least `nbits` cells). Prefer the `StackBuf`: a frame cell is addressed directly, so `bits[i]` at a compile-time index is free where a heap read is a `DEREF`, and the booleanity pin `bits[i] = b * b` is then one `MUL` rather than a `MUL` and a `DEREF`. Use `addr` below where the run must also be indexed at runtime or reached from elsewhere.

## Cost cheat sheet

| construct | instructions |
|---|---|
| `x = <literal>` / `GEN ** k` | 1 `SET` |
| `a + b` | 1 `XOR` |
| `a * b` | 1 `MUL` |
| `a / b` | 1 `MUL` (write-once back-solve; division by zero is undefined) |
| heap read / store `buf[i]` | 1 `DEREF`; +1 `MUL` for a *runtime* index (a compile-time g-power offset folds into the `DEREF`, for free) |
| stack read `sa[k]` | 0 (direct cell addressing); a *store* is 1, like any other write |
| `assert a == b` | 1 (+ 1 `SET` amortized per frame for the zero cell) |
| `assert a != b` | 3 (`XOR`, `MUL`, `SET`), no branch, one hinted inverse |
| `assert log x < k` | 3 (+1 `SET` amortized per bound per frame; a runtime bound costs 1 `MUL` instead) |
| `if a == b: …` | 3 (+2 to skip a non-empty `else`; +2 amortized `self-fp` per branching function); **0 if the condition is compile-time** |
| `… = match(log(x), …)` | ≈ 7 for the dispatch + the arm; results written into the targets directly. Uniform-call arms (`lambda k: f(a, b, k)`) **fuse**: one shared frame + dispatch to entry, each arm just `SET`+`JUMP` |
| function call | ≈ `n_args + n_returns + 4` (0 when the callee is `@inline`) |
| `mul_range` iteration | body + ≈ 1 `MUL` + 1 `XOR` + call overhead |
| `unroll` iteration | body only (compile-time replication) |
| `blake2s(a, b, out, ...)` | 1; plus one `SET` once per frame per distinct metadata value, and two more when `cv` is omitted; message/CV words are read in place, +1 `DEREF` per heap input or CV word, +1 `MUL` per runtime slice start |
| `hint_witness(dest, "name")` | 0 (+1 `MUL` for a runtime slice start) |

Every cost above is the FIRST occurrence. Two identical pure operations in one function share one cell and the second is free, so `hb[i]` twice, or `row[i]` where `row = hb * GEN ** 2`, costs one pointer `MUL` between them. The sharing stops at a branch: a cell whose instruction sits inside an `if` is not reused after the join, because the other path leaves it unwritten and therefore prover-chosen.

## Example

Fibonacci in the exponent (`tests/programs/fibonacci.py`): `fib[g^k]` holds `GEN ** F_k`, so one field `MUL` is one Fibonacci step.

```python
# public_input: GEN ** 89, GEN ** 89
from snark_lib import *


def main():
    fib = HeapBuf(12)
    fib[1] = GEN ** 0  # F_0 = 0
    fib[GEN] = GEN     # F_1 = 1
    for i in mul_range(1, GEN ** 10):
        fib[i * GEN * GEN] = fib[i] * fib[i * GEN]
    out = fib[GEN ** 11]
    assert out == GEN ** 89  # F_11 = 89
    assert log(out) < log(GEN ** 128)
    p = GEN ** 0
    p[1] = out
    p[GEN] = out
    return
```

## Not (yet) supported

Mutable variables; conditions other than field (in)equality; `match` default and non-contiguous arms; multi-file imports; `Const` parameters as `mul_range` or range-check bounds (a substituted literal is a bit-pattern element, not the g-power a bound needs); runtime slice starts on a `StackBuf`; precompiles beyond `BLAKE2s`.
