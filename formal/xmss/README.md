# XMSS security formalization

This Lean project formalizes the classical random-oracle security game from `doc/xmss/main.tex`. The main result is `xmss_has_127_bits_of_classical_security`, a machine-checked 127-bit theorem for the concrete scheme `Concrete.scheme`.

The project separates what is proven from how it is proven. A reviewer only has to read `XmssSecurity/Statement.lean`. It contains, in order, the concrete parameters and types with the tweak and byte layout of every hash input and the target-sum encoding, the three algorithms (key generation, signing, and verification, with the oracle hash calls they make), and the strong-unforgeability experiment, defined once generically in the scheme, instantiated at `Concrete.scheme`, and stated as the security claim `XmssSecurityStatement`. The root module `XmssSecurity.lean` discharges the claim against the proof. Neither file imports proof machinery; the proof lives under `XmssSecurity/Proof/` and never needs to be trusted, only checked by Lean.

The scheme deliberately uses an ideal precomputed secret key containing every WOTS chain value and Merkle node. Key generation samples these values through the random oracle and stores them as the pure replay of its own query log: each stored table entry is the same oracle computation, rerun with every hash query answered from the recorded cache. Signing reads the stored tables and queries the random oracle only for message encoding, once per attempt, for at most `2^23` attempts. Repeated table reads are not random-oracle queries. This isolates the cryptographic computation from implementation-specific storage and caching choices.

The adversary has access to the shared random oracle and a signing oracle. Signing responses are logged. Reusing a signing epoch invalidates the transcript, and the strong-forgery check rejects only an exact replay for the claimed message and epoch. The query bound covers the entire experiment, including key generation, adversarial queries, signing, and final verification.

The theorem's axiom footprint is limited to Lean's standard `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`. It contains no `sorryAx` or compiler-evaluation axiom. The root module pins this footprint with `#guard_msgs`, so the build fails if it ever grows.

The main proof spine is organized by mathematical stage: `CappedGlobalKeygen` constructs the presampled key-generation view, `CappedGlobalTreeCacheCorrespondence` fixes the WOTS endpoint tables once and couples all tree hashes under one cache invariant, `CappedGlobalCausalSetup` couples the result to signing and the causal experiment, `CappedGlobalChainOutputUniformity` samples the complete chain-output table, the five `CappedGlobalChainHigh*` modules establish setup, local coupling, replay, whole-game coverage, and reduction, and the four first-lane modules establish the experiment, source coupling, transport reduction, and final bound.
